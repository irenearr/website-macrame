My name is Irene and this is my website. Here I showcase one of my favorite hobbies: making macram\\xE9 plant holders. I named my brand \\\"handmade by Irene Arr\\\", because it's an alias I often use. It comes from a time long ago when parties were still allowed and my best friend and I dressed up as.. pirates! Arrrr. Nowadays I'm studying to be a web developer and this is actually the first complete website that I've built. So let me tell you a little bit about me. I am educated as a cell biologist, studying the human body, diseases, and how it all works, mainly on a really tiny scale: the microscopic level. As a cell biologist I worked many hours inside a labaratory or behind my desk reading and writing scientific studies. To relax from the tedious work I needed to break away from it all through festivals (as I mentioned before), but also handicrafts. Working with your hands is a great way to quiet your mind a little. I've done different things such as painting and sculpturing, but my most recent distraction is macram\\xE9. It's so easy to learn and you can make beautiful things with it! Combined with my love for plants, I started to make macram\\xE9 plant holders right here at my home in Amsterdam. The result is what you see on this site, lots and lots of different designs and using all kinds of materials. I hope you'll enjoy browsing, feel free to contact me with any questions!
